This project aims at manipulating the data provided from WeRateDogs Twitter account using different source of datasets. The main focus on this project will be the data evaluation and cleaning to conclude intersting insights based on the thorough analysis and visualization. Then, data about the dogs names, rating, and beauty classification have been interpreted to provide insights as a conslusion of this analysis.

## Summary of Findings
1. Based on the first analysis block "Most Beautiful and Used Dog Names", we can conclude that although the mostly used name like "Charlie", "Oliver", "Cooper", and "Lucy are not the highly rated dogs. We find the highly rated dogs have "Atticus" as name.  

2. Based on the Dogs Beauty Ratings analysis, we can declare that approximately 16% of the dogs in the dataframe are adorable, or extremely beautiful. The majority of the dogs, or 41.7%, are rated as Good. This can be explained by the fact that the majority of people are rating dogs nearly to 10. Others who rate more than 10 (where the denominator is 10) have resulted in higher results and highly rated dogs.  

3. For the Dogs' Stages analysis, we figured out that most of the dogs in this dataframe are in the Pupper stage and the least present are in the Floofer stage. Yet, dogs in the Doggo phase are the highest rated. This can be explained by the fact that the younger the dog is, the cuter can be seen yielding to higher rates.
